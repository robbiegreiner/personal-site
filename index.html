      <h4>career changer</h4>
      <p class="about-me-text">I am currently in the process of changing careers.  In 2013 I graduated from Iowa State University with a degree in Construction Engineering.  I spent the last four years working for three different construction firms as a Project Engineer in Iowa and Colorado.  During my four years in construction, half my time was spent in the field solving problems and the other half was spent in the office estimating and bidding on projects. Being a project engineer combines engineering skills to read and interpret engineered construction drawings along with business and management skills to manage people, schedule and finances.  Construction is a fast-paced industry and tough problems needs to be solved quickly.  I learned a lot and developed many skills during my time in construction but I always knew it was not the career for me.</p>
      <h4>en-route to becoming web developer</h4>
      <p class="about-me-text">I had known for the last couple years that I wanted to get into software engineering.  My plan for quite some time was to return to a traditional university and obtain a computer science degree.  I got accepted into multiple programs, including The University of Colorado in Boulder and Oregon State University.  While it would have been great to learn the fundamentals and theory of Computer Science, these programs required multiple years and wouldn't necessarily make me job-ready for a software engineering position upon graduation.</p>
      <h4>turing</h4>
      <p class="about-me-text">While applying to computer science programs at different universities, I started to get ads targeted to me for coding "bootcamps".  I hadn't ever heard too much of these coding schools before.  I started to research coding schools and eventually discovered Turing School of Software & Design in Denver.  I exhaustively researched and did my homework on Turing.  Eventually I attended a try coding weekend at Turing.  I was hooked.  Turing's community and teaching style was amazing.  I interviewed for a spot in the next cohort, was accepted and began class 6 weeks later.  </p>
